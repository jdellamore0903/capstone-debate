This is my capstone project for the coding bootcamp I took at Actualize Coding School. The idea behind this project was to create an online interface that allowed users to participate in structured debates. The format of the debates closely resembles that of "policy debate." I did policy debate for a number of years in high school and college and am still actively involved on the NYU Debate Team as a coach!

A few notes:
  1) The functionality for the debates themselves is mainly there. There are a few additional things I would like to add in the future when I have sometime. 
  2) One of the coolest parts of the application (in my mind) is the entry of evidence into the database. As I continue to learn more, particularly as I begin to learn more about machine learning, I think it would be really interesting to play around with a lot of data that exists in the "card" format (i.e. a body of text from a journal/article and an associated "tag" put in by the user that makes/summarizes the argument. On a large-scale, I believe this could provide a cool training set for programs that attempt to refine research search methodologies. 
  3) An additional feature I would like to add that is more related to the second point is a "literature review" section that takes the highest rated pieces of evidence for a certain topic and ranks it. This is a basic model method that I unfortunately did not have time to finish up before presenting. If I end up circling back to this project, I would love to add something like this as it could produce a really awesome "reading list" that I would have found really interesting as a debater. 
  
I hope there are some enjoyable features or concepts. Let me know if you have any questions.
